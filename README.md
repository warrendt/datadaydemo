SESSION BRIEF

EFFICIENT LAB MANAGEMENT WITH INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE ON AZURE

In this session, we will explore how to leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to efficiently manage lab environments in Azure. 

Learn how to spin up resources quickly, conduct your testing, and tear them down just as fast to save costs. This hands-on session will demonstrate setting up a lab, deploying a database with a BACPAC, running tests, and then destroying the environmentâ€”all within a couple of hours. 

We will also cover best practices to ensure compliance and data security, making sure no sensitive information leaks during the process. By the end of the session, attendees will have access to a GitHub repository with scripts and templates to replicate the scenarios demonstrated.
